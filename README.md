# Houses vs Salary
Have you ever wondered what you can get for your salary in different cities? Look no further, Houses vs Salaries gives you an insight of what the average prices of houses are in cities like San Francisco, Portland , Miami or San Antonio. We also show you a ranking of what city has the best salary/house price ration based on your job. This Web App was built with ReactJS and used information from Zillow, Glassdoor and utilized Google Maps API. Shutout to Glassdoor for not providing an API to get the average salary of job in a specific city, without your lack of support we would have never written a WebScraper to get this information from your platform ourselves.
